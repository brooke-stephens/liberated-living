					<h3>I like to say that I was KICKED into spirituality or self-awareness from a lifetime of self-sabotage, guilting, minimiZing and shaming myself.</h3>
					<p>At my crossroads, it was as if the universe presented me the choice of 1) continuing with a familiar painful life that was no longer bringing me happiness but rather was destroying my relationships, my work and most notably, my self-worth or 2) giving up the life I knew, the person I knew myself as, and confronting my deepest, darkest fears, to hopefully create a life and a person that was more resilient and radiant than the woman I left behind. Having the courage to look within and explore the seemingly, scary unknown, triggered an awakening that brought more peace, balance and bliss, than I could have ever imagined. Since that moment, I’ve wanted everyone to experience that sense of liberation and empowerment for themselves.</p>
